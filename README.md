# JavaScript 30 ‚Äî ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-JavaScript-yellow?logo=javascript)

This repo contains my solutions & experiments for [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) by Wes Bos ‚Äî a 30-day vanilla JavaScript coding challenge.  
No frameworks, no libraries, no boilerplate ‚Äî just pure JS, HTML, and CSS.

| Day | Project                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 01  | **Drum Kit**           | Built a drum kit that plays sounds when keys are pressed. Learned about `keydown` events and working with audio elements in JS.                                                                                            |
| 02  | **CSS + JS Clock**     | Made an analog clock with real-time updates using CSS transforms and JS date methods.                                                                                                                                      |
| 03  | **Blur Image**         | Learned how to use `<input type="range">` sliders to update CSS variables dynamically with JavaScript. Practiced DOM manipulation using `dataset` and `document.documentElement.style.setProperty()`.                      |
| 04  | **Array Cardio Day 1** | Got swole with arrays using `.filter()`, `.map()`, `.sort()`, and `.reduce()`. Learned how to manipulate object arrays and string arrays. Also got comfy with `console.table()` for that clean debug output.               |
| 05  | **Flex Panels**        | Played with flexbox panels that expand and contract on click. Learned how to combine `flex`, `transition`, and `transform` for smooth animations. Got comfortable with `transitionend` events to trigger animations in JS. |
| 06  | **Ajax Type Ahead**    | Made a live search for cities/states using `fetch` + `RegExp`. Highlighted matches, formatted numbers, and handled empty input.                                                                                            |
| 07  | **Array Cardio Day 2** | Practiced advanced array methods like `.some()`, `.every()`, `.find()`, and `.findIndex()`.                                                                                                                                |
