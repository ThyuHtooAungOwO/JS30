Learned about `keydown` events and working with audio elements in JS.                                                                                                                                              |
| 02  | **CSS + JS Clock**                      | Made an analog clock with real-time updates using CSS transforms and JS date methods.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 03  | **Blur Image**                          | Learned how to use `<input type="range">` sliders to update CSS variables dynamically with JavaScript. Practiced DOM manipulation using `dataset` and `document.documentElement.style.setProperty()`.                                                                        |
| 04  | **Array Cardio Day 1**                  | Got swole with arrays using `.filter()`, `.map()`, `.sort()`, and `.reduce()`. Learned how to manipulate object arrays and string arrays. Also got comfy with `console.table()` for that clean debug output.                                                                 |
| 05  | **Flex Panels**                         | Played with flexbox panels that expand and contract on click. Learned how to combine `flex`, `transition`, and `transform` for smooth animations. Got comfortable with `transitionend` events to trigger animations in JS.                                                   |
| 06  | **Ajax Type Ahead**                     | Made a live search for cities/states using `fetch` + `RegExp`. Highlighted matches, formatted numbers, and handled empty input.                                                                                                                                              |

| 08  | **Fun with Canvas**                     | Built a rainbow brush paint app using `<canvas>`, practiced `mousemove` events, ctx.`strokeStyle`, `lineJoin`, `lineCap`, and dynamic `lineWidth` with HSL colors.                                                                                                           |
| 09  | **Dev Tools Tricks**                    | Learned handy Chrome DevTools shortcuts: live DOM edits, console magic, breakpoints, and network tricks.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 10  | **Hold Shift to Check Multiple**        | Made a Gmail-style checklist app using checkboxes + `shiftKey`.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 11  | **Custom Video Player**                 | Made a styled `<video>` player with custom play/pause, skip, volume, and progress bar controls.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 12  | **Key Sequence Detection**              | Built a mini easter-egg feature that listens for a specific sequence of key presses (like the Konami Code). If the sequence matches, it triggers a fun action.                                                                                                               |
| 13  | **Slide in on Scroll**                  | Implemented scroll-based animations where images slide in smoothly as they enter the viewport. Practiced working with scroll events, window.innerHeight, and `debounce` to optimize performance.                                                                             |
| 14  | **JavaScript Reference vs Copy**        | Learned the difference between copying primitives vs references, and practiced cloning arrays/objects with `slice`, spread, `Array.from`, and `Object.assign`.                                                                                                               |
| 15  | **LocalStorage and Event Delegation**   | Build a simple todo list application that adds and stores items using JavaScript. This exercise will reinforce array and object manipulation, event listeners, and introduce the browser's `localStorage` API for persistent data storage.                                   |
| 16  | **CSS Text Shadow Mouse Move Effect**   | Created a dynamic `text-shadow` effect that responds to mouse movement. Enhanced styling with multiple shadows and vibrant colors for an interactive neon glow effect.                                                                                                       |
| 17  | **Sorting Band Names Without Articles** | Practiced array sorting in JavaScript by removing leading articles (`a`, `an`, `the`) from band names before sorting. Reinforced skills with regex, string manipulation, and custom comparator functions in `sort()`.                                                        |
| 18  | **Adding Up Times with Reduce**         | Use `reduce()` to calculate the total time and practiced modular arithmetic to convert total seconds back into hours, minutes, and seconds.                                                                                                                                  |
| 19  | **Webcam Fun**                          | Implemented real-time video manipulation using `<canvas>` and `getImageData()`. Practiced pixel-level editing to filter out color ranges (chroma key/green screen effect), experimented with sliders for dynamic thresholds, and debugged issues with default slider values. |

| 20 | **Native Speech Recognition** | Explored the Web Speech API to capture real-time speech from the user. Practiced handling `SpeechRecognition` events (`onstart`, `onresult`, `onend`, `onerror`), managed interim and final transcripts, implemented dynamic language selection, and debugged issues with instant recognition errors and browser compatibility. |
