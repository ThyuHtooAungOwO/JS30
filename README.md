# JavaScript 30 — ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-JavaScript-yellow?logo=javascript)

 
This repo contains my solutions & experiments for [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) by Wes Bos — a 30-day vanilla JavaScript coding challenge.  
No frameworks, no libraries, no boilerplate — just pure JS, HTML, and CSS.
